CHALLENGES

DAY 1:
Finding Podcast APIs

DAY 4:
Bugs, bugs, bugs.

DAY 5:
The growing pains of learning CSS (i.e. stick nav bar "fixed position" was overlaying headers), redrawing routes, unfamiliarity with Redux auth (missing steps)

DAY 6:
Deciding how to add structure data tables, what to calculated on the back end (popularity) vs hard code in data table, also deciding how to delegate tasks to which reducers (i.e. updating user's )

DAY 7:
Spent the better part of a day trying to debug a carousel that only displayed properly upon an initial refresh. Didn't fix it so decided to use another react library.

DAY 8:
Trashed the carousel completely to accommodate button layover. Tried to use SQL to calculate popularity on the back end and took some time figuring out active record.
